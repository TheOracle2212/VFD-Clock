# VFD-Clock
Literally everything and anything related to my clock. Anything else goes in my blog.

Read my blog here to learn more about it:


Anyways, the code goes in the code folder, the hardware goes in the hardware folder. Don't be afraid to ask questions - more than happy to reply to them.
I don't expect the project to be largely reproducible/replicatable, but I hope that the code in there is useful as a springboard for more similar projects or variants. 
This was just after all, an excuse to play around with a Vacuum Florescent Display.

The code was kinda messy and half me and half Claude/ChatGPT, but I managed to optimise it so that it runs as efficiently as possible. Note that even with all those lines (~400), I managed to get just inside 3% of storage memory. Am I that good or (more likely) is the Raspberry Pi Pico that good? It has lots of cool things in it like Syncing to the RTC !(Discussion here)[https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico/issues/2832], Sunrise/Sunset calculations, to Roman Numerals and Timezone calculations.
Feel free to use whatever parts of the code that you need, whenever you need. I've tried to make everything as easy as possible to follow with lots of comments in there, but again, if you need anything, please let me know.

The hardware design isn't supposed to be something in the MOMA, but moreso something befitting the VFD. I'm not too sure what the goal was, but I think it looks pretty chic and came when I went to the Louvre.

I'll post some pictures soon (I keep saying that!!)

Have fun!
